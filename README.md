# Hopfield-networks
This exercise is predominantly concerned with Hopfield networks and associative memory. First, we will look at some simple networks using the Hebbian learning principle, which is often employed in recurrent networks. You will construct an autoassociative memory of the Hopfield type, and explore its capabilities, capacity and limitations.
